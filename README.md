# BlackJack


# A webapp to play Black Jack!

This project will be designed to play Black Jack on a web browser.
The game will be played with one deck where the player will try to beat the dealer.
After each game where either the player or dealer wins, the deck will be reshuffled for randomness purposes.
There will be a score to keep track of the player or dealer's win total.
