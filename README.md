# BlackJack


# A webapp to play Black Jack!

This project is a web app to play Black Jack on the browser.
This project is designed with one deck which is randomly shuffled with the Fisher-Yates algorithim each time the game is played. The purpose is to win the game - which can be achieved by beating the dealer. Here is a link to the rules of BlackJack if you aren't familiar with them or need a refresher of the general idea of the game. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack).

# Version 2

In the next iteration of this game, I would like to build 3 key features that will enhance the user experience: fix the value of Ace, add insurance and doubling features, fix BlackJack feature to allow player to bet prior to reshuffling the deck. Currently, Ace values are hard-set to 11 which changes the strategy of the game. I want the Ace to reflect its dynamic uses of being either 1 or 11. Additionally, I think it's important  to build out features that make BlackJack unique - thus, I want to add insurance and doubling to the gambling feature to capture the essence of BlackJack. Lastly, my game can be redesigned to allow better user interaction between gambling, playing, and being presented with information. Ideally, I'd like to fix this flow to provide the best experience for the user.
